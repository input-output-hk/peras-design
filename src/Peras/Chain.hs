-- | Chain validity
--
-- A chain is valid iff:
-- * the blocks (ignoring the vote hashes) form a valid Praos chain,
-- * all votes:
--      * are referenced by a unique block with a slot number $s$
--        strictly larger than the slot number corresponding to the
--        voteâ€™s round number r (i.e., r*T < s),
--      * point to a block on the chain at least L slots in the past
--        (i.e., to a block with slot number s < r*T - L), and
-- * it contains no vote equivocations (i.e., multiple votes by the
--   same party for the same round).
--
-- TODO: expressing those conditions directly would be very expensive,
-- it's more efficient to enforce them whenever the chain is extended.
