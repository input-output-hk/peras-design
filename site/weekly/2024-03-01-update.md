## Present

* Quviq SoW has been signed and we had a first meeting with the team, presenting them the current state of the prototype and what our expectations were
* Refactored Agda specification to support easier proofs of some properties. This rippled over the code base as Agda types representation is our reference
* First (simple) implementation of a Rust Peras node which passes the `peras-quickcheck` `NodeModel` tests, albeit quite slowly
* More faithful implementation of Peras protocol in `peras-iosim` including cooldown period
* Started experimenting with Î”Q modeling and tinkering with existing core repositories
* First Monthly review [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GBalxAoFxwQyRdw-DX5zSOm2Vdgf58C6NEQx7PvOWl0/edit#slide=id.g2bc0b536d7f_0_26) and [recorded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Q0YoT_hVbMjL19YW76epcx1wbeH_O_N/view?usp=sharing)
* Workshop in Paris confirmed, will take place on April 9-10 at the [Mobiskill](https://mobiskill.fr/) office in the 9th district
* Started discussion with Consensus team over downstream implementation challenges for Peras
* Clarified the situation of [alternative remediations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dv796m2Fc7WH38DNmGc68WOXnqtxj7F30o-kGzM4zKA/edit#heading=h.8lhps0p37gcs) to finality: They should be addressed directly by the Consensus team as there's no need for Innovation stream to be involved

## Future

* Work on providing some answer to a key question raised by Core tech team: How does Peras will fare when the network load increase from the current 40% to expected 80%?
* Some secondary questions to answer when it comes to engineer Peras in Cardano:
  1. Can we get rid of counting dangling votes when selecting best chain?
  2. How to deal with the size of votes to diffuse if they are needed for chain selection, given the necessity of header/body split in Cardano?
* Improve fidelity of the simulation w.r.t. actual network protocol used in Cardano, eg. push vs. pull model
* Complete Rust node and use [netsim](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ce-netsim) library to manage routing between nodes
* Start more concrete work with PNSol and Quviq on their respective area of expertise
