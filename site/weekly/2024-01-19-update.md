* Project has not been moving much around the Christmas holidays
  period due to people being off and/or busy elsewhere
* I have explored the option of embedding the Peras R&D work into the
  Scaling tribe as a way to get up to speed faster but this option was
  abandoned
* Some changes to the team have been acknowledged:
  * _Trym Bruset_ will be our Product manager as he is also involved with side-chains work
  * _Brian Bush_ expressed strong interest in joining the team and
    will be working on joint FM/prototyping work
* Interviewed _Artjoms Sinkarovs_ (currently on an internship in FM
  team) for being hired on a permanent contract to work on Peras
* As we are planning to do a lot of work around Model-based test
  generation, I have started discussing with Quviq on how they could
  be involved in Peras
  * They expressed a lot of interest as it really falls into their
    skillset and domain (they have a lot of expertise in both Agda for
    formal spec work and QC-based test generation of course)
