## Present

* Got results from "split-brain" experiment with 100 nodes that basically confirm the faithfulness of the IOSim implementation and highlights some "interesting" consequences of Peras, namely that when the split-brain heals, it's not the longest chain that wins but the one with the most votes
* Started work on implementing IOSim node that represents network interactions more faithfully, eg. using a _pull_ model that mirrors the actual `ChainSync` protocol implemented in the cardano-node
* Rust node passes the `NetworkModel` tests, with multiple nodes connected through a `netsim`-based layer. Aligning the implementations posed some interesting challenges, especially in the domain of time management (real vs. simulated time) and the scheduling of the various "actors" in the system
* Research shared with engineering a new version of the protocol which introduces _Certificates_ to aggregate votes in the block headers and mostly get rid of the problematic _dangling votes_ concept
* First meeting with PNSol on Î”QSD modelling of the protocol
* Meeting with Spyros Voulgaris on [Peernet](https://github.com/PeerNet/PeerNet) on the topic of network simulator. This is the tool that's used by researchers when they need some numbers.
* Starting significant redesign of IOSim node to cope with changes in the protocol

## Issues

* We need to improve communication between research and engineering, and how changes are shared and notified
