## Present

- Met with Intersect Consensus WG to discuss CIP process as it relates to Peras
- Simulation of *margin* and *reach*
- Began internal reviews of Peras technical report
- Dynamic QuickCheck tests for `peras-markov`
- Added configurable adversarial behaviors to Markov-chain simulation
- Website improvements (rendering as PDF)

## Future

- Rough draft of CIP
- Continue internal reviews of Peras website, technical report, Agda specification, and online simulator

## Issues

- A CIP to establish a "consensus category" is required prior to submitting specific CIPs like Peras
