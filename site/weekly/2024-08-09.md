## Present

- Completed CIP for Peras as self-contained literate Agda with supporting technical analyses and arguments
- Worked on soundness proofs for Peras executable specification
- Briefed Intersect's Core Infrastructure (CI) working group on Peras
- Coordinated plan with Quviq for including adversarial actions in conformance tests
- Created standalone version of IOG Agda Prelude

## Future
- Reviews of Peras CIP

## Issues
- We need a decision process for determining when to move the Peras CIP from its current draft state (internal review) to the ready to review state (public review).
