## Present

* We managed to scaffold a "chain of evidence" from Agda model to prototype implementation, gathering knowledge and good intuition in the process on how the various pieces fit together
* Creative engineering continued work on a [Network simulator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ce-netsim) in Rust, completing FFI so that it can be used in to build a prototype that we can test against
* Investigation on what's the current state of ΔQ resources and how it could be applied to our problem
* Quviq SoW still in the hands of Procurement, waiting finalization

## Future

* Quviq SoW signature and execution
* Implement an IOSim version of Praos/Peras (honest) node, porting existing code from previous experiment
* Implement a Rust version of Praos/Peras node
* Demonstrate "evidence trail" on a Peras-related property (selection of heaviest chain by honest nodes?)
* Engage with PnSol on ΔQ
* Prepare in 1st monthly demo meeting
* Organise in-person workshop in Paris, April 9-10

## Issues

* Still unclear what's the situation of [alternative remediations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dv796m2Fc7WH38DNmGc68WOXnqtxj7F30o-kGzM4zKA/edit#heading=h.8lhps0p37gcs) for faster settlement proposed during the Edinburgh Peras workshop?
