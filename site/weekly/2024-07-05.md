## Present

- Conformance test based on Peras executable specification in Agda
    - Automated using `agda2hs`
    - State-machine property-based test using `quickcheck-dynamic`
    - Full coverage of voting logic
    - Successful testing of the Haskell prototype/reference implementation
- Partial completion of soundness proof
    - Agda proofs connect relational specification to executable specification
    - Linked directly to conformance tests
- Implemented cryptography for voting sortition
- Successful experiments with fast convolution for use in Î”Q modeling
- UX enhancements for simulation and visualization tools
- Updates to second technical report

## Future

- Complete soundness proofs
- Complete second technical report
- Draft CIP
- Plan PI7

## Issues

- Various `agda2hs` awkwardness and bugs
