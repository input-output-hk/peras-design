## Present

* Started "serious" work with the team on modeling and simulating Peras protocol.
* Main focus is currently on ensuring all the pieces of the puzzle fit together:
  * Yves is working on the modelisation in Agda of the protocol, leveraging previous work done in Coq on Ouroboros Praos
  * Brian is experimenting with simulation of Praos/Peras in Haskell, with the goal of being able to visualise the evolution of the system over large periods of time and simulating the impact of the protocol parameters
  * Arnaud is exploring model-based testing, towards applying quickcheck-dynamic generated tests on a simulated network of nodes
* Creative engineering started work on a [Network simulator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ce-netsim) in Rust and we have made some preliminary experiments to connect such a simulator to tests generation process
* Quviq SoW has been completed and is now in the hands of Procurement to be hopefully finalised in the forthcoming days

## Future

* Quviq SoW signature and execution
* Continue work on the whole "Simulation process", fitting the various parts together:
  * Express (and prove?) some properties in Agda...
  * ... then generate code from Agda to use in Model-based tests generation and simulations ...
  * ... to run properties against code and produce simulation results.
* We plan to start recording hosting monthly demos

## Issues

* What's the situation of the [alternative remediations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dv796m2Fc7WH38DNmGc68WOXnqtxj7F30o-kGzM4zKA/edit#heading=h.8lhps0p37gcs) for faster settlement proposed during the Edinburgh Peras workshop?
* Open-sourcing the repository is not desirable while research is still working on the paper
