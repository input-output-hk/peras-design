# Votes & Certificates

## ALBA Certificates

* [ALBAs](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/approximate-lower-bound-arguments/) appears to provide a good basis for Peras certificates
* The [Prototype implementation in Haskell](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/alba) provides some evidence this construction could be feasible in the context of Peras

### Proving & Verification time

The following picture plots the time needed (in milliseconds) to build certificate for varying number of votes, assuming a security parameter of 128, honest share of 67% and vote size of 256 bytes.

We can observe that even in some extreme cases proving time stays consistently under 20ms and on the average is between 10 and 15ms for even large number of items. The wild variation in proving time for different number of input set is explained by the non-deterministic nature of the algorithm: We construct the proof through depth-first search, by repeatedly comparing hash values _modulo_ the expected number of honest items, so the number of comparisons and hashes to make may vary significantly depending on how the ordering of the list of items.

It's worth considering whether or not this dependency on the ordering of the items could be an attack vector as proving time could easily explode in case we need to explore more than a small fraction of the tree.

Verification time has not been plotted but is lower than 1ms in all the cases considered as it is tied to the number of hash computation one has to make which is $O(u + s_p)$.

### Certificate size

For a given set of parameters, eg. fixed values for $\lambda_{sec}$, $\lambda_{rel}$, and $n_p/n_f$ the proof size is perfectly linear and only depends on the size of each vote:

![Proof size / vote size](../diagrams/alba-proof-size-fixed-params.svg)

Varying the security parameter and the honest votes ratio for a fixed set of 1000 votes of size 200 yields the following diagram, showing the critical factor in proof size increase is the $n_p/n_f$ ratio: As this ratio decreases, the number of votes to include in proof grows superlinearly.

# Analyses of adversarial scenarios

## Adversarial chain receives boost

***Question.*** What is the probability that an adversarial chain receives the next boost?

***Scenario.*** It currently is round $r$ and a certificate was created in round $r - 1$ for a block at least $U + L$ slots in the past that is also in the common prefix of the honest and adversarial chains. The honest parties lengthen one fork by $m \ge 0$ blocks to the next candidate for voting (i.e., the newest block on that fork that is at least $L$ slots old) and the adversarial parties similarly lengthen a separate fork by $n \ge 0$ blocks. If the adversarial chain is revealed to the honest parties before the start of the new round $r$ and if the adversarial chain is longer (i.e., $n \gt m$), then the voting committee will vote to boost the adversarial chain. The per-slot probability of adding a block to the honest or adversarial chain is $p$ or $q$, respectively.

![Adversarial chain receives boost](../diagrams/adversarial-chain-receives-boost.png)

***Analysis.*** Assume that the block- and vote-diffusion times are negligible, so that the last boosted block is indeed the last block before slot $r \cdot U - U - L$ and that the honest and adversarial candidates are indeed the last blocks on their forks before slot $r \cdot U - l$. (Note that this neglects the probability that the adversary will privately extend the last boosted block before slot $r \cdot U - U - L$.) Thus the lengthening of the two forks during the $U$ slots are the last boosted block are binomially distributed with parameters $m$ and $p$ (honest) and $n$ and $p$ (adversarial). The probability of $m < n$ is

$$
P = \sum_{0 \le m \lt n \le U} {U\choose{m}} p^m (1-p)^{U-m} {U\choose{n}} q^n (1-q)^{U-n}
$$
and the following R function implements this computation:

```R
prob <- function(U, p, q) {
  sum(pbinom(1:U-1, U, p) * dbinom(1:U, U, q))
}
```

***Example.*** Let the active-slot coefficient $\alpha = 0.05 \, \text{slot}^{-1}$ and let $f$ be the fraction of adversarial stake, so $p = \alpha \cdot (1 - f)$ and $q = \alpha \cdot f$. Plot the probability of the dishonest boost as a function of the adversarial fraction of stake and the round length.
