### Peras Meeting

* Cardano Vision workshop -> CH + Research plan for next years
* Intermediate solutions to speed up finality -> low hanging fruits
  * CH ask about anti-grinding?
  * Peter also asked what happened to anti-grinding?
* grinding = making a block makes it possible to manipulate future lottery to make more block
  * introduce some PoW to calculate nonce over the epoch
  * no work on the Peras R&D team
  * could be good to still track it here and ensure it's making progress and tackled by someone?

* Peras paper: Alex, Aggelos, Christian, Peter, Sandro
  * targeting CCS but it's a bit soon
  * draft of the paper?
  * what kind of support? -> depends on the venue
  * could be good to have some kind of artifact

* Formal model ?
  * Best known approach so far : https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12105
  * We need to start somewhere -> Write Sandro's algorithm in Agda
  * Could then port proof techniques from Coq
