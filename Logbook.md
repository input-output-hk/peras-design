### YH - Model in Agda

* Moved the initial implementation of the semantics into a separate module: [SmallStep.agda](src/Peras/SmallStep.agda)
* Similar for the proofs: [SmallStep/Propeties.agda](src/Peras/SmallStep/Propeties.agda)
* The small-step semantics implement closely the semantics proposed in the PoS-NSB paper

### BB - Nix, Agda, and Haskell housekeeping

1. Reconciled Haskell package dependencies.
2. Switched to IOGX-style flake.
3. Included pre-built Agda standard library.
4. Added `nix build .#peras` for building the Peras library in Agda and Haskell.
5. Nix-based CI.
6. Cabal file for Haskell code generated by `agda2hs`.

*Issue:* the Nix-based CI test takes ~28 minutes, but this will be far faster when caching is enabled.

### Pairing session - Agda modelling of messages

Some resources on agda2hs:
  * What's  the best practice for generating code from Agda?
  * Haskell.Prelude contains Agda exports suitable for Haskell
  * agda2hs tutorial: https://agda.github.io/agda2hs/tutorials.html and [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3546189.3549920)
  * The most elaborate project so far is [agda-core](https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-core/), which itself relies on a Agda/Haskell library for well-scoped syntax (https://github.com/jespercockx/scope).

Together with AB we started to work on the extraction of the model from Agda to Haskell using `agda2hs`
* The tool requires to put the `AGDA2HS` pragma for all data types that are exported
* We renamed constructors to be upper case and type parameters to be lower case as required in Haskell
* Data types that used the standard library had to be adjusted. For example we changed the `Block` data type that used `set` to a parameterized data type:
```agda
open import Data.Tree.AVL.Sets renaming (⟨Set⟩ to set)

...

record Block (t : Set) : Set where
  field slotNumber : Slot
        blockHeight : Word64
        creatorId : PartyId
        parentBlock : Hash
        includedVotes : t
        leadershipProof : LeadershipProof
        payload : List Tx
        signature : Signature

Block⁺ = Block (set HashO)
```
* The import of `Data.ByteString` in Haskell is possible using the `FOREIGN` pragma

We then try to parameterise the `Block` type on the agda side to be able to inject whatever we want as concrete type, but agda2hs does not like our kind for the parameter -> needs to be a `Set`, or a simple type-level expression.
There should be a way to map types/imports from Agda to HS?

We have some kind of strategy to go from Agda, sticking to "simple" types wherever we need it but it's not entirely satisfactory as we are losing information in the process
Then got an interesting discussion with some other agda2hs user:

> I found that if I had something in Agda that couldn't turn into
> Haskell then I was going to wrong way - you need to figure out what
> it looks like in Haskell and then try to handle that in Agda, rather

### Team session

Q: How does Praos Security model relates to PoS-NB paper's model? Seems like the latter is simpler, has stronger assumptions thus leading to weaker guarantees

Some high-level questions being discussed:
* What are the next steps on simulations?
* Could be good to have "foundation" code in Agda and then evaluates simulation tools using always the same code in order to ensure interoperability
* JSON serialisation is hard in Agda, need to be done at generated code level
* Write down the types together?

What is a good property to express?
* How to express finality?
* What are block diffusion properties and their impact on the finality => impact on nr. of peers on speed of finality

Exploring simulation tools:
* discrete event simulators?
* not too much concerned about scale?
* could leverage https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-sim

Some hypothesis about Peras protocol itself:
* if $A$ is too low, cooldown periods happen to often
* Later discussion w/ researchers tell us $A$ is not so important because the protocol is geared towards optimistic cases, so it can be small

Cool idea we played a bit with: Have a visualisation up and running as a demo so that people can tweak the parameters to see how the protocol is behaving. Then we can gamify it, asking people to share their favorite parameters set and run more thorough simulations with those parameters. It will also be a nice way to engage with the community and have apeople understand the benefits and tradeoffs of this new protocol extension.

Code generation:
* Trying to write a simple model of the message types in Agda and generate HS code
* Default generator yields unreadable and encoded haskell -> not super
  useful for embedding in QC, so we'd rather want [agda2hs](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs) which generates pretty readable code

Possible experiment:
* build a slurp node
* Run the node in various datacenters connected to other peers
* store the chain following data -> reconstruct the progress of the chain at vartious point in time
* Is this not what the CF is doing with their Cardano network monitoring project? => ask for more information

    - Refactored random-number generation.
    - Refactored types into separate module.
    - Refactored graph visualization into separate module.

    - The code is still hacky and disposable.
    - Vertical alignment of blocks by slot in visualization.
    - Display of voting-round boundaries in visualization.
- Observations
    - `StatefulGen` and `IOSim` don't easily coexist.
    - Visualization the block production, voting, and forking is practical for many nodes and slots.
    - The Peras procotol can equally well be simulated via a centrally managed or a distributed simulation, but a distributed simulation seems cleanest and closest to the protocol.
- Next steps
    - Consider whether it is worthwhile further developing the model, or whether it would be better to re-architect the model in Agda or in a simulation framework.
    - Document visualization lessons-learned and next-generation design.

### YH

Reading the PoS-NSB paper and Coq code
  * Use of `math-comp` library in Coq takes getting used to
  * Sketched the relation on what states are reachable, i.e. the small steps semantics and the transitive closure in Agda
    https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design/blob/d90f164d5b5d1ac15bc6c8126d8180addb872681/src/Peras/Chain.agda#L131-L151

#### AB - Test Model

Reading PoS-NSB paper let me think about how to generate meaningful tests:
* The Model could generate a valid sequence of transactions, inject
  them in arbitrary nodes, and verify all nodes converge to a valid
  maximal chain
* This requires modelling txs which is annoying
* We could instead have the Model just play the role of the
  network/diffusion layer for blocks (And later votes) and select
  block to broadcast from whatever each node has made available some
  blocks, possibly injecting also rogue blocks. This removes the need
  to forge transactions and put the model in the shoes of the
  adversary, interposing itself between otherwise honest nodes

Trying to get a working environment (Again) but I have issues with
HLS/LSP: Code action for filling missing variables did not work, so I
upgraded to latest available `lsp-haskell` but now I get another
error:

``` Symbol’s value as variable is void:
lsp-haskell-plugin-cabal-code-actions-on ```

Managed to propertly configure auto formatting for Haskell on local
environment for Peras, such that it picks up the right configuration
file.  I ditched use of lsp-format-code action because it's borked as
per https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/411


Pushed a first version of a test model, along the lines sketched above.
The model's actions are very simple:
* `Tick` to advance the slot for all nodes,
* `ObserveChain` to retrieve the current best chain from a node.

Then when `perform`ing `Tick` on the real nodes, they will produce
some `Block`s which will be broadcast to other nodes, possibly later
with some delays or loss...

A basic property that could be interesting to state as our first test
would be the _Common Prefix_ property:

``` do anyActions_ getState >>= \ nodes -> do chains <- mapM (action
. ObserveBestChain) nodes assert $ all ((< k) . lengthDivergingSuffix)
chains ```

eg. all nodes' potential forks are not deeper than the security parameter `k` or equivalently all nodes have a common prefixs.

When we express properties for Peras, we could have this property
provide a tighter bound than `k` in the "steady state", or fallback to
`k` when confronted with adversarial behaviour.

### BB

[Initial work in progress on a crude simulation of peers, chains, and forks](random-forks/ReadMe.md):

- Generates a reasonable but random topology of peers.
- Simplified election of slot leaders.
- Simplified lottery of voting committee.
- Forking of chain and message passing to downstream neighbors.
- The chaining is a work in progress, with several glaring but easily remedied deficiencies.
- The code is unpolished and hacky.
- The next step would be to add an approximation of the Peras protocol.

This is a disposable model, just  for exploration and building intuition.

#### AB

Trying to assess what would be most useful to start working on for Peras.

We basically have a few moving pieces that need to fit together:
* A formal (eg. Agda-based) model of the protocol, along the lines of [Formalizing Nakamoto-Style Proof of Stake](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/917)
  * need to analyse the original paper and the modeling and proof techniques used
  * need to port those to Agda
* An executable encoding of this formal model that's suitable for use by quickcheck-dynamic (or similar tool) to generate test traces for the protocol
  * requires to be able to generate something from Agda?
  * requires some kind of modeling of the environment of an instance of the protocol -> need to be done at the formal level too?
* Some driver/glue code to be able to actually test an executable (prototype) against this specificaiton/environment
* An actual prototype
  * need to be "embeddable" in order to maximise testing capabilities and minimise time, eg. use some form of IPC/shared memory instead of relying on full-blown network communications
  * abstracts away the details of the communication, e.g assumes some form of async message-passing from a network layer

Some interesting article defining what it means to formalise a Nakamoto consensus: https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/stifter2018agreement.pdf

Looking at generated code from Agda:
* HS code is just unreadable: names and symbols are encoded, variables are just numbered with a single character prefix, etc.
* Not sure what this `MAlonzo` thing is? -> https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Docs/MAlonzo says it's the standard compiler backend that generates Haskell from Agda code

As expected, generated code should be treated as opaque and "Sealed" and not easily amenable to extensions and modifications

Perhaps I should just start focusing on a simple aspect, e.g the Chain
Weight algorithm. Algorithm is rather complicated as it involves both
chains and votes and is pretty critical for the system. Other option
is to go top-down and just ignore the details of chain weight for the
moment, eg. write the pure protocol state machine model and build the
full chain from that?


Looking at
[AFLNet](https://thuanpv.github.io/publications/AFLNet_ICST20.pdf)
article which leverages AFL fuzzer to work on protocol/network
systems, not sure how this is done or if there's actual introspection
of the fuzzed system as AFL does

Retrieving https://github.com/AU-COBRA/PoS-NSB and adding as submodule for peras,  then trying to "Build it".
My memories of Coq are a bit blurry but it seems necessary to understand how they formalised the problem if we hope to be able to replicate it for Peras

#### Ensemble session

##### Topology of the network

A good experiment to evaluate it:
* Spin-up nodes all over the network and check propagation time
* Would allow us to create realistic simulation
* build an intuition about the structure of the network
* how much of the protocol survives depending on topology of netwokr

We might want to start asking now to experts what the actual topology looks like:
* Start w/ network team
* -> Karl Knutsson + Markus Gufler
* Galois ? -> CNSA project -> ?


Key metrics we might want to evaluate for running Peras:
* bytes storage => Disk
* bytes in RAM => Mem
* nbr + size of messages => impact on bandwidth
* pooltool.io -> measure latency

first-order -> network details independent, use distribution (ΔQ)
* used dQ in Marlowe to reason about degradation and back-pressure
* used fixed size queues -> tell the client to wait

partial deployment of Peras?

which formal model?
* experiment with https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-high-assurance ?
* try to formalise a piece of it? -> better go down the Coq/Agda route
* good inspiration for Agda: https://github.com/oracle/bft-consensus-agda

#### Some estimates for the protocol params

Some values for the parameters

* $T$: the length (in slots) of a voting round --> order of a few network deltas
* $K$: the length of a cooldown period (in voting rounds) --> large
  enough so that order of $b\times n + k$ blocks are produced in time $T\times K$,
  where $k$ is the current common-prefix parameter
* $L_{low}$, $L_{high}$: define vote-candidate window -->
  * $L_{high}$: some constant so that we think there is common prefix in
    practice if we cut off blocks newer than $current_time - L_{high}$;
  * $L_{low}$: should in theory be security parameter to guarantee that
    there exists a block in the interval $[L_{low}, L_{high}]$
* $A$: max. age for including vote --> security parameter to ensure
  honest votes get included (because of bad chain quality of Praos)
* $\tau$: number of votes required for quorum -->
  $`  \frac{3}{4\times n} + 2\times\delta, \mathrm{for some} \delta > 0  `$
* $b$: weight boost per vote --> prob. some small constant
* $W$: weight to cut off for common prefix --> order of security
  parameter; should be informed by the fact that R successful voting
  rounds give error
  $` e^{-2\delta\times b\times n\times R} `$
* $n$: committee size: order of security parameter to avoid
  adversarially dominated committees; we're also hoping to make it
  work for smaller committee sizes at some point

### Peras Meeting

* Cardano Vision workshop -> CH + Research plan for next years
* Intermediate solutions to speed up finality -> low hanging fruits
  * CH ask about anti-grinding?
  * Peter also asked what happened to anti-grinding?
* grinding = making a block makes it possible to manipulate future lottery to make more block
  * introduce some PoW to calculate nonce over the epoch
  * no work on the Peras R&D team
  * could be good to still track it here and ensure it's making progress and tackled by someone?

* Peras paper: Alex, Aggelos, Christian, Peter, Sandro
  * targeting CCS but it's a bit soon
  * draft of the paper?
  * what kind of support? -> depends on the venue
  * could be good to have some kind of artifact

* Formal model ?
  * Best known approach so far : https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12105
  * We need to start somewhere -> Write Sandro's algorithm in Agda
  * Could then port proof techniques from Coq
