This repository is intended to host more or less formal specifications, experiments, models for the Ouroboros Peras protocol.

## Roadmap

- Complete proofs.
    - Voting strings.
    - Liveness of the protocol.
    - Soundness of the executable specification.
    - Synchronize with Praos formalization.
    - Prepare a publication or online supplement.
- Complete conformance suite.
    - Tests for non-voting parts of the protocol.
    - Serialization format and inter-process communication for testing third-party implementations.
    - Package for easy installation and use.
- Recommend parameter values.
    - Seek and analyze stakeholder requirements, especially from partner chains.
    - Develop a parameter-evaluation tool (based on the Markov-chain simulator) that provides a full set of impact metrics for a given set of parameters.
- Reach out to stakeholders.
    - Populate website with latest results.
    - Online versions of all analysis, simulation, and visualization tools.
    - Organize a stakeholder workshop and/or a Intersect Consensus Technical WG.
        - Feedback on specification format.
        - Feedback on conformance suite.
        - Feedback on and refinement of the draft CIP.
- Tooling fixes and enhancements
    - Improve the usability, efficiency, and testing of the Î”Q software.
        - Provide out-of-the-box and possibly interactive visualization.
        - Provide faster numeric computations (e.g. using discretized CDFs and fast vector operations, possibly offloaded to GPU).
        - Provide additional combinators (e.g., quantile-arrival time) for the DSL.
    - Improve the protocol visualizer.
        - Allow users to inject adversarial behavior or network disruptions (e.g., "split brain" scenarios).
        - Make visualization scalable in the browser to long chains (i.e., hours of simulated block production) and large networks.
    - Improve the prototype simulator.
        - Add an efficient implementation suitable for large networks and long simulations.
        - Create a simple DSL for inputting simulation scenarios for both honest and adversarial behavior.
    - Improve the Markov-chain analyzer.
        - Add a DSL for defining scenarios.
        - Add visualization and analysis tools.
    - Collaborate with higher-resolution network simulation efforts, potentially implementing Peras on them.
        - PeerNet
        - ce-netsim
- Move from the "pre-alpha" to the "alpha" version of the protocol.
    - Requires completion of the Peras paper.
    - Formalize and implement the preagreement YOSO abstraction.

## Documentation

* [Weekly updates](docs/weekly) provide regular "heartbeat" about the
  state of the project and what the team is working on
* [Logbook](Logbook.md) contains a detailed account of problems,
  successes, failures, ideas, references and is intended as a tool to
  help the team members stay in sync
* We document our main design and architecture decisions along the way
  using [Architectural Decision Records](./docs/adr).

## Hacking

### Agda

#### With nix

The repository provides a nix flake from which one can enter a development shell suitable for Agda using the following command:

```bash
nix develop
make
```

The Peras library for Agda can be built with `nix build .#peras`.

#### Without nix

Please check instructions for [Installing Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html) on the official website.

Peras code requires agda-stdlib, check out instructions for [installing libraries](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/package-system.html) and do not forget to:

* Add `standard-library` to your `~/.agda/defaults` file
* Add `<path to>/standard-library.agda-lib` to `~/.agda/libraries` file

### Checking

To typecheck all `.agda` source files:

```
make
Checking Peras.Block (./src/Peras/Block.agda).
Checking Peras.Chain (./src/Peras/Chain.agda).
Checking Peras.Nakamoto (./src/Peras/Nakamoto.agda)
```

To remove all `.agdai` files produced:

```
make clean
```

### Haskell

Use `nix develop` to enter a development shell that contains all of the required Haskell package dependencies. In that shell, `cabal build all` will build the haskell packages.

Alternatively, one can build the packages directly via Nix:
- `nix build .#peras-hs`
- `nix build .#peras-iosim`
- `nix build .#peras-quickcheck`

#### Profiling

Furthermore, use `nix develop .#profiled` for a shell with profiled versions of all of the packages. One can place a file `cabal.project.local`, with the contents below, in the root folder of this repository and then build profiled code with `cabal build`.

```cabal
library-profiling: True
profiling: True
package *
  ghc-options: -O2 -threaded -fprof-auto -fprof-cafs "-with-rtsopts=-N -p -s -hc -i0.1 -ls"
```
