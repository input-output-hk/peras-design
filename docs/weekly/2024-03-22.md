## Present

* Built a first ΔQ model reconstructing the Cardano network high-level modelling originally published in the ΔQSD paper
  * Discussed with other innovation streams how ΔQ competes or complements network simulation
* Started work on a [Technical Report](../reports/tech-report-1.md), currently including only part of ΔQ analysis. The goal is to be able to publish this report as an outcome of Paris Workshop
* Continued refactoring of IOSim node, including [contra-tracer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/contra-tracer) based logging to improve observability of the prototype behaviour and standardize analysis
  * IOSim node now implements a faithful block diffusion mimicking real-life process
* Started concrete work with Quviq on Agda <-> Quickcheck integration and on a first [simple example](https://github.com/input-output-hk/peras-design/tree/agda-quickcheck-prototype)

## Future

* Prepare and deliver Monthly Demo, should include network congestion simulation, initial ΔQ analysis of Praos and Peras, new formal model of algorithm in Agda
* Realign various parts of the code (Agda, Haskell node, quickcheck tests, Rust node) over shared interfaces and common types
* Complete prototype implementing new version of the protocol (with certificates)
* Express more interesting properties in QuickCheck
* Work with Quviq on Agda/QuickCheck integration
* Polishing Agda model and more work on proofs

## Issues

* How do we make our formal modelling in Agda effort more efficient for both Research and Engineering?
* Brian will be on PTO the first week of April
